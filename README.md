# Tabnabbing Vulnerability Demo

This project demonstrates a common web security vulnerability known as **tabnabbing**.  
It uses three simple HTML files to show how a malicious page opened with `target="_blank"` can secretly redirect the original page to a fake phishing site.  

The demo also includes the **fix**, showing how to prevent this attack using the `rel="noopener noreferrer"` attribute.

---

## How to Run the Demo

You can run this demo in two ways:

### Method 1: Direct Method
The HTML files are already included in this repository.

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.
3. Click the **"Click Here for a Prize!"** button.
4. Observe how the original tab is secretly redirected to the fake login page.

---

### Method 2: Using the Setup Script
This method regenerates the demo files using the provided script.

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Open a terminal in the projectâ€™s directory.
3. Make the script executable:

   ```bash
   chmod +x setup.sh
   ```

4. Run the script:

   ```bash
   ./setup.sh
   ```

5. Once the script finishes, open the newly created `index.html` in your browser and click the button to see the demo.

### The Fix

The code in this repository uses a JavaScript `window.open()` function to demonstrate the vulnerability. The fix is to sever the connection between the original tab and the new tab by blocking access to the `window.opener` object.

To apply the fix to the code in this project, open the `index.html` file.

Since **"window.open('malicious.html');"** 
Opens a malicious page without protection find the "window.open('malicious.html');"
line within the `<script>` tag and replace it with this line, which adds 'noopener' as the third argument.

```javascript
// Opens a new tab safely by severing access to window.opener
window.open('malicious.html', '_blank', 'noopener');
```
Now go back and see the magic happens on the original tab **(which is index.html page) **

ðŸŽ‰ Congratulations! Youâ€™ve successfully completed the Tabnabbing demo and learned how to protect your apps against this attack.

### Note for Standard HTML Links
For projects that use a standard HTML `<a>` tag instead of JavaScript, the fix is to add the rel="noopener noreferrer" attribute.

### Vulnerable HTML Link
```html
<a href="malicious.html" target="_blank">Click Here</a>
```

### Fixed HTML Link
```html
<a href="malicious.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Click Here</a>
```

## Additional Notes

- `noopener` ensures the new tab does not have access to `window.opener`.  
- `noreferrer` additionally hides the referrer information.  
- Always use these attributes when opening untrusted or external links with `target="_blank"`.
